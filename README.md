Capstone project with USPTO 


This file contains the description of each file essential to the project.
The project has been divided into three parts Scraping, Data Analysis,
and Virtual Reality. Each part can be worked on independently, however
care must be taken during the transfer of data. Hence, the input format
for each step has been described below.

**Description**

The established United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) routing 
process from a patentâ€™s issuance to its approval is cumbersome and 
time-consuming. One aspect that makes the process arduous is the involvement
of many supervisors between its initial and final stage. 

We intend to use our technology to make this routing process more efficient
by providing a virtual reality platform to allow a seamless transition in 
the life of a patent from its issuance to its approval for the examiners at
the patent office. Our virtual reality platform provides an accurate
representation of a patent under consideration within representations of
patents addressing similar technologies and allows for exhaustive analysis
of documents using Natural Language Processing.

By considering information and data gathered by the USPTO through years, 
we intend to assist patent examiners by suggesting patents to them which
pertain to topics in which they specialize.

### SCRAPING

The files were downloaded from PatFT:
	
	http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/index.html

**DownloadData.py**
	This script scrapes the data from the PatFT website for USPC 706
	class. The data is stored locally for further analysis.
	The process can be stopped anytime by pressing CTRL + C

**ScrapeData.py**
	It takes a BeautifulSoup (Python Library) object of an .html page
	downloaded using DownloadData.py and returns the required information.

**SummarizeData.py**
	Uses the ScrapeData.py script to format the data from all the 
	downloaded patents into a .csv file which will be used in the Analysis.

### ANALYSIS

### VIRTUAL REALITY

Everything required for the project is contained in the ./Assets folder

**nuget_packages**
Do not edit. Handled by the plugins.

**Plugins**
Do not edit. Plugins imported to handle VR.
* SteamVR: Interface between the headset and the computer
* TextMeshPro: Handles text shown in 3D.
* VRTK: Virtual reality toolkit contains the basic components required
  VR such as, the model of the controller, handling input etc.

**Prefabs**
All the objects used in this Unity project.
* ControllerScripts: Handles input.
* Dragger: Handles the dragging of the patent to show more information
* Environment: The lights and the floor.
* Filter: Contains the text and selector for the chosen filter.
* ObjectTooltip: ###FILL###
* PatentManager: Prefab for the patent manager script
* PatentPopUp: The panel containing the patent information
* SettingsPanel: The controller of the VR space. Contains three panels
  color coding, filter, and patent info

**Resources**
##### *EDIT*

**Scenes**
Contains only the main scene.

**Scripts**
Description is present in the script itself.

**Shaders**

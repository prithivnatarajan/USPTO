Capstone project with USPTO 

The established United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) routing process from a patent’s issuance to its approval is cumbersome and time-consuming. One aspect that makes the process arduous is the involvement of many supervisors between its initial and final stage. 

We intend to use our technology to make this routing process more efficient by providing a virtual reality platform to allow a seamless transition in the life of a patent from its issuance to its approval for the examiners at the patent office. Our virtual reality platform provides an accurate representation of a patent under consideration within representations of patents addressing similar technologies and allows for exhaustive analysis of documents using Natural Language Processing. 

By considering information and data gathered by the USPTO through years, we intend to assist patent examiners by suggesting patents to them which pertain to topics in which they specialize.
